# Feature Engineering - Flash Crash synthetic Data with Generative Adversarial Networks


## <a id="overview"></a>Overview
Data can sometimes be difficult to find or expensive and time-consuming to acquire. Furthermore, data can be sensitive and difficult to share. In such situations, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)s can be a valuable tool. Artificially recreating a dataset is a complex and sensitive process. The new data need to correctly mimic the existing data distributions and not introduce biasing or noise in the dataset. GANs can uncover the deeper structure of a small dataset to create an infinite amount of new data.
